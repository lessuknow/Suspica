# Suspica
Game made for Experimental Game Design. 

Due to the project being rather small (two weeks) and the team also being small (one programmer (me) and one artist),
git wasn't needed for it. Instead, the entire project is uploaded at the end for use as a "portfolio" of sorts.

The theme is:
  educating people that don't want to be educated ->
  that is an issue due to bias in the media ->
  this is an example on how bias is introduced into media.
